### This webpage was created from a practice point of view. There are a lot of different features which I've listed below:

- When you hover over the header, it changes `color` and the text size becomes `bigger`.
- Some text generated from lorem ipsum. At the end of the first p tag, there is a link to one of my favorites [![Bret Fisher's video about Kubernetes](http://img.youtube.com/vi/4CzG4Uqd9jM)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CzG4Uqd9jM)
- Next we have some to do's such as ***Have breakfast, Walk the dog and Work, work and work*** .
- 3 li tags named as ***One", "Two" and "Three***. "One" and "Three" are using a class called ***special***. The color, font-size and border have been customized in the app.css.
- Then we have an 5 input tags. The first is for the ***bear name***; input for ***password*** and a ***checkbox***, a ***range*** and a ***submit***.
- Next we have a picture of a bear.
- Please scroll down a bit and you will see a list tag of dogs, not in any specific order. However my favorite dog is a ***Vizla*** and I have included a picture of it in the index.js as newImg.
  The Vizla uses the same class ***special*** as the other li tags mentioned above.  
- Lastly next to the picture of the Vizla, there is an a tag ***Dogs are adorable!***.
